# LoanDatasetAnalysis
Analysis of loan dataset to predict loan status outcome and interest rate

## Documentation:
This dataset can be found in the Loan Data from Prosper library [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv) with feature documentation available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0).

## Description:
The Prosper Loan Dataset consists of information regarding 113937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.

## Steps:
The dataset is cleaned to remove the unnecessary data and also the data that is not structured.<br>
Next the dataset is analysed to identify relationship between features which helps in decision making.<br>
Finally, the relationship is made visual using different graph types.<br>

The file 'exploration_template.ipynb' is used to explore the dataset and identify relationship between factors.<br>
The file 'Slide_Deck_Template.ipynb' provides a final presentation of the very relevant factors and its role in predicting the loan status and interest rate.<br>

The 'output_toggle.tpl' is a code which allows only the code result to be displayed in the presentation created from Jupyter Notebook.<br>
